# ChristmasDraw
JAVA - Coursework 1

ChristmassDraw2.java --> Initial code done last year. Didn't meet all requirements.
XmasDraw3.java --> Code done this year. Meets all requirements.


1- This exercise allows students to practise and use their knowledge of arrays and
conditionals and iterations, loops to solve the given problem.

2- Given the following scenario: a family consisting of 5 couples decide they don’t
want to buy a Christmas present to everyone in the family but, each member
of the family will buy a nice present to only one person. 

The five couples are as follows:
couple1 = (x1, y1), couple2 = (x2, y2), couple3 = (x3, y3), couple4 = (x4, y4) and couple5(x5, y5)

I was asked to write a program called ‘ChristmassDraw.java’ for the family's
Christmas draw. 

Program should generate two draws; this year and next year’s draw
taking into account the following constraints:

• Couples are not allowed to buy for each other(i.e. xi is not allowed to to
buy for yi and vice-versa).

• This year’s draw combinations are not allowed in next year’s draw(i.e. if
xi is buying for xj this year then xi is not allowed to buy for xj
next year).
